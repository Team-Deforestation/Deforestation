                        <p class="words">A main reason for deforestation is for the resources that a forest contains. Forests are destroyed to grow  crops and raise animals because why not tear down a natural envirnment to make your own man-made envirnment. Forests are ravaged for their resources such as minerals, fossil fuels, and timber. Sure in the now perspective it seems as if this is a great jump towards the betterment of humanity, but looking into the future this will have damaging effects on our planet.</p>

                        <p class="brown words">Deforestation is done to make space for roads and highways which will ultimately lead to the development of whole communities. Deforestation is the direct cause of climate change due to it releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases previously stored in trees and soils into our atmosphere. These changes lead to problems for these communities such as harmful air pollution, erosion, and the inevitable moving in of wandering animals. </p>

                        <h1>Fires</h1>
                        <p class="words">Fires are a great benefactor in the deforestation across the world. Although not all fires are created equal, they all have an effect on the longevity of a forest due to the severity of the fires. Due to our planet's current state and the burning of fossil fuels, random fires are recurring leading to the already congested air being filled with more carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide not only came from the fire itself but also the carbon dioxide released from the decomposition of the trees.</p>
